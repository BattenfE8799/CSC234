/*
The Game class serves to organize all the information we need for our game.
It contains a vector of Rooms (the room list), as well as the current player
location.

Because we have an ID for each room, we can simply store locations as ints.

To keep things more organized, we've made separate functions for setting up
the game, and playing the game.

For your assignment, you should use this structure with your own room names,
descriptions, and "map" of how they are organized. You should have 5-7 rooms.

Finally, using the method discussed here, move your player through the rooms,
and use describe() to print out the output -- giving a tour of the game.
